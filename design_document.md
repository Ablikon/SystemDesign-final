# Open Science Collaboration Hub: System Design Document

## 1. System Overview and Scope

The Open Science Collaboration Hub transforms how scientific research is conducted by connecting researchers with remote laboratory equipment across institutional boundaries. This platform allows scientists to reserve, operate, and collect data from specialized instruments remotely, while collaborating in real-time with peers worldwide.

Scientific research faces critical bottlenecks: expensive equipment concentrated in wealthy institutions, difficulty reproducing experiments, and siloed expertise. Our system breaks these barriers by creating a network of shareable scientific instruments accessible to researchers regardless of location or institutional affiliation.

### Problem Statement
Research equipment costing hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars sits idle in laboratories around the world, while researchers elsewhere lack access to the tools they need. The traditional solution—traveling to use equipment or sending samples—is inefficient, expensive, and unsustainable.

### Solution
Create a platform that connects scientific instruments to the internet and enables researchers to:
- Discover available equipment worldwide
- Reserve time on instruments
- Remotely control equipment through standardized interfaces
- Collect and analyze data in real-time with collaborators
- Share and reproduce experimental protocols

### Target Users
- **Research Scientists**: Looking to access specialized equipment not available at their institution
- **Laboratory Managers**: Seeking to increase utilization of expensive equipment and generate additional funding
- **Research Institutions**: Wanting to foster collaboration and maximize return on equipment investments
- **Industry Researchers**: Needing occasional access to specialized equipment without full purchase
- **Students and Educators**: Learning to use advanced equipment through remote access

### Scope
**Within Scope:**
- Equipment discovery and reservation system
- Remote equipment operation interfaces
- Real-time data collection and visualization
- Collaborative workspace for analysis
- Experiment protocol sharing and versioning
- User authentication and authorization
- Usage reporting and billing

**Out of Scope:**
- Physical instrument maintenance
- Shipping of physical samples
- Direct financial transactions between institutions (handled externally)
- Long-term data storage beyond project completion
- Custom interface development for every type of scientific equipment

### Experimental Data Model (InfluxDB)

InfluxDB is a time-series database optimized for high write and query loads with time-stamped data. The data model uses:

- **Measurements**: Equipment readings, sensor data, control commands
- **Tags**: Equipment ID, experiment ID, user ID, parameter names
- **Fields**: Actual measurement values, status indicators
- **Timestamps**: When the measurement was taken

Example data point:
```
measurement: temperature_reading
tags: equipment_id=123, experiment_id=456, sensor=main_chamber
fields: value=98.6, units=celsius, status=normal
timestamp: 2023-05-01T15:30:00Z
```

### File Storage Structure (MinIO)

MinIO provides S3-compatible object storage for experimental files:

- **Buckets**: Organized by experiment ID
- **Objects**: Raw data files, processed results, protocol documents, media
- **Metadata**: File type, creator, timestamps, associated equipment
- **Versioning**: Enabled for tracking changes

### Database Access Patterns and Optimization

- **Caching**: User profiles cached in Redis with 15-minute TTL

#### Equipment Database
- **Indexing**: Multi-column indexes on category, location, and specifications
- **Queries**: Complex filtering on specifications, category, and availability
- **Denormalization**: Common query paths denormalized for performance

#### Reservation Database
- **Partitioning**: Partitioned by month for efficient time-range queries
- **Indexing**: Indexes on equipment_id, user_id, and time ranges
- **Constraints**: Enforces non-overlapping reservations per equipment

#### Time Series Database
- **Retention Policies**: Raw data retained for 30 days, downsampled data for 1 year
- **Continuous Queries**: Automatic downsampling for long-term storage
- **Sharding**: Distributed across multiple nodes by equipment type

#### File Storage
- **Lifecycle Policies**: Automatic archiving of older files to cold storage
- **Caching**: Edge caching for frequently accessed files
- **Access Control**: Pre-signed URLs for temporary access

The implementation will prioritize end-to-end functionality over feature completeness, demonstrating the full system flow from equipment discovery to data collection and sharing.

## Conclusion

The Open Science Collaboration Hub represents a transformative approach to scientific research, breaking down barriers between institutions and democratizing access to specialized equipment. The system's architecture balances the competing needs of real-time control, data security, and collaborative analysis while providing a foundation for future expansion.

By implementing this design, we create not just a software system but an ecosystem that can accelerate scientific discovery and foster collaboration across geographic and institutional boundaries. The modular, scalable architecture ensures the platform can grow with increasing adoption and evolve to meet the changing needs of the scientific community.
